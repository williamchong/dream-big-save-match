# Girl Match Dash

A game developed for Global Game Jam Hong Kong 2025, exploring AI-assisted solo game development.

## About the Game

Girl Match Dash is a 2D action-adventure game with roguelike elements. You control a matchstick that has fallen into the ocean and must guide it back to the surface. The match summons three little girls whose dreams create protective bubbles, shielding it from water and debris.

### Core Mechanics
- Control the matchstick's movement while it automatically rises
- Manage protective bubbles created by the little girls' dreams
- Avoid obstacles and collect power-ups
- Make strategic upgrade decisions between levels

## Development Approach

This project serves as an experiment in AI-assisted game development for solo developers. The development process leverages:

- **AI Code Generation**: Using AI (Claude) to generate initial code structure and implementations
- **AI Design Assistance**: Utilizing AI to brainstorm and refine game mechanics
- **AI Documentation**: Generating and maintaining documentation with AI assistance

### Project Structure 
Refer to the [project_structure](project_structure) file for the project structure.

## Development Goals

1. **Explore AI Tools**: Test the effectiveness of AI assistance in game development
2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Use AI to quickly iterate on ideas and implementations
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of both the game and the AI-assisted development process
4. **Best Practices**: Leverage AI to suggest and implement gaming industry best practices

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- AI Development Assistant (Claude)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Use arrow keys or mouse to control the matchstick
4. Press SPACE to start the game

## Development Process

This game is being developed as a solo project with AI assistance. The development workflow includes:

1. Design discussions with AI
2. AI-generated code structure and implementations
3. Human review and modification
4. AI-assisted debugging and optimization
5. Documentation generation and maintenance

## Lessons Learned
- AI doesn't know import requires script type=module
- AI knows Canvas API much better than framework like Phaser
- AI doesn't make build system importing libraries
- AI doesn't setup typescript build system for you when using ts
- In editor chat (Cursor/Copilot) by now is easier to use than Copilot Workspace

## Future Improvements

- Add more complex obstacle patterns
- Implement power-up system
- Enhance visual effects
- Add sound effects and background music
- Create multiple endings based on player choices
