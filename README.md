# 賣女孩救火柴 Dream Big Save Match

A game developed for Global Game Jam Hong Kong 2025, exploring AI-assisted solo game development.

## About the Game

在這款獨特的文字輸入遊戲中，玩家扮演一根掉入海中的火柴，必須透過輸入與主題相關的關鍵字來保護自己。火柴會召喚原本要販賣的女孩們，運用她們的夢想之力來對抗海中的威脅。

### Core Mechanics

- **文字輸入戰鬥**: 輸入與主題相關的關鍵字來增強夢想之力
- **時間限制**: 每個關卡都有固定的時間限制
- **連擊系統**: 快速輸入可以提高獎勵倍數
- **主題探索**: 每個關卡會隨機選擇一個女孩的夢想主題
- **能量對決**: 在時限結束時比較夢想之力與敵人的強度

## Development Approach

This project serves as an experiment in AI-assisted game development for solo developers. The development process leverages:

- **AI Code Generation**: Using AI (Claude) to generate initial code structure and implementations
- **AI Design Assistance**: Utilizing AI to brainstorm and refine game mechanics
- **AI Documentation**: Generating and maintaining documentation with AI assistance


## Development Goals

1. **Explore AI Tools**: Test the effectiveness of AI assistance in game development
2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Use AI to quickly iterate on ideas and implementations
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of both the game and the AI-assisted development process
4. **Best Practices**: Leverage AI to suggest and implement gaming industry best practices

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- AI Development Assistant (Claude)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser

## Development Process

This game is being developed as a solo project with AI assistance. The development workflow includes:

1. Design discussions with AI
2. AI-generated code structure and implementations
3. Human review and modification
4. AI-assisted debugging and optimization
5. Documentation generation and maintenance

## Lessons Learned
- AI doesn't know import requires script type=module
- AI knows Canvas API much better than framework like Phaser
- AI doesn't make build system importing libraries
- AI doesn't setup typescript build system for you when using ts
- In editor chat (Cursor/Copilot) by now is easier to use than Copilot Workspace
