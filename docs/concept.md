### Game Concept

## Overview
This is an HTML5 JavaScript game about a matchstick that falls into the sea and must rise back to the surface under the player's control.

The story is a playful reinterpretation of the well-known tale of The Little Match Girl. In the original story, the girl burns matches to survive a cold night. In this game, however, the match acts as a gacha-style vendor, carrying little girls who represent characters with unique dreams. The match falls into the ocean due to a strong wind, and in desperation, it summons girls it was originally selling, using their dream as bubble to protect itself from water and monster

## Gameplay

The game is divided into levels. In each level, there would be an enemy. A random theme (girl's dream) would be picked. Player would have to enter related keywords related to the theme.

- Each level has a time limit.
- A random theme is picked, which is related to a dream of the little girls.
- Entering keywords related to the theme would increase the strength of the dream. Negative keywords would decrease the strength of the dream.
- After the time limit is reached, the strength of bubble is compared against the strength of the enemy. If the bubble is stronger, we go into next level, otherwise player lose.
- Entering keywords in a quick sequence (also known as combo) would increase the bonus multiplier of the keyword entered. The time limit in which keywords are considered combo are determined by a timer, higher the combo, shorter the timer is.


## Key Themes
The game is designed to explore themes of nurturing and balance. The little girls’ dreams serve as a metaphor for potential and vulnerability, and it is the player’s responsibility to protect and support them. By encouraging players to make balanced and empathetic choices, the game conveys the message that caring for others with fairness and foresight leads to stronger outcomes in the end.
