### Game Concept

## Overview

This is an HTML5 JavaScript game about a matchstick that falls into the sea and must rise back to the surface under the player's control.

The story is a playful reinterpretation of the well-known tale of The Little Match Girl. In the original story, the girl burns matches to survive a cold night. In this game, however, the match acts as a gacha-style vendor, carrying little girls who represent characters with unique dreams. The match falls into the ocean due to a strong wind, and in desperation, it summons three of the little girls it is carrying. Each girl’s dream creates a protective bubble that shields the matchstick from water and debris. The player must guide the match back to the surface while managing its abilities and the balance between itself and the protective bubbles to survive the depths.

## Gameplay

The game is divided into levels. In each level, players control the matchstick using either the mouse or arrow keys. The match automatically rises at a speed that depends on the current level and skill upgrades. As it ascends, players must:

- Avoid obstacles to prevent damage.
- Collect items to gain experience for leveling up.
- Use the bubble shield to block debris or hazards.

As the match rises, it will eventually reach a "level marker," which signifies the end of that level. Progressing through levels becomes more challenging as new obstacles and mechanics are introduced.

## Abilities & Leveling

Players can upgrade various abilities between levels to improve the matchstick's and the bubbles' performance. Examples of upgradable abilities include:

- Shield Depth: How much damage the shield can absorb.
- Shield Width: The size of the protective bubble.
- Match Speed: How quickly the match ascends.
- Match Agility: How responsive the match is to player input.

Players must carefully decide which abilities to upgrade. These decisions strongly influence the gameplay experience and the match’s chances of survival in subsequent levels. Some levels are specifically designed to test the balance between the matchstick’s capabilities and the bubbles' protection. Players who fail to maintain a balanced approach may struggle to progress.

## Randomized Events

Between levels, players will encounter randomized events that present them with interesting or difficult decisions. These decisions may affect the matchstick's or bubbles' skill levels, offer bonuses for the next level, or introduce new challenges. This element brings a roguelike aspect to the game, adding variety and replayability.

## Art Style & Storytelling

The game will feature simple pixel art to convey its whimsical and melancholic tone.

The story begins with a quick introductory cutscene explaining the matchstick’s predicament. Afterward, the narrative unfolds through the randomized events and choices made between levels. The overarching theme emphasizes the importance of protecting the dreams of the little girls.

If the player neglects to upgrade the bubble sufficiently or fails to balance upgrades among the different girls (representing unequal treatment), certain levels will become nearly impossible to complete. Conversely, players who make thoughtful, balanced choices may face greater difficulty in the early game but will find the later levels more manageable as the little girls’ dreams grow stronger and more resilient.

## Key Themes

The game is designed to explore themes of nurturing and balance. The little girls’ dreams serve as a metaphor for potential and vulnerability, and it is the player’s responsibility to protect and support them. By encouraging players to make balanced and empathetic choices, the game conveys the message that caring for others with fairness and foresight leads to stronger outcomes in the end.
